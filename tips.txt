Note: The following commands needs to be executed from /home/zhangkun/Development/Experiment/Lihui-Learning/CC 

1. How to deliver codes to gitHub 
    step1. Check status of the repo  
           $> git status /home/zhangkun/Development/Experiment/Lihui-Learning/CC 
    
    Step2. Define files to be commited  
           If untracked files, add all of them to the repository
           If "Changes not staged", add all of them using the following command
    
           $> git add <file-to-track>
       
    Step3. Deliver all the changes to repository( locally ) 
           $> git commit -m "<message for your self>" 
    
    Step4. Push the latest version to GitHub  
           $> git push original master
    
2. How to rebase from GitHub, rebase means download the latest changes from 
   GitHub server, and solve the confilcts.     

   step1. Use git status to check current status of the repo. 
          Make sure all the latest changes are commited. Commit all the files 
          that are 'modified' 'statges' or 'untracked'
          
          $> git status . 

   step2. Pull the latest version from remote server on GitHub 
     
          $> git pull -u original master 

          Note: 
          2.1 
          in this step, you make asked to input some merge message. 'merge' means 
          a file on the server is found different from the local version; so the two versions 
          need to be merged together to get a complete version.   
        
          What's more complicated is that, differnt contributors may modify the same part of 
          the file. In this case, a 'conflict' is found. If there aren't any conflicts, merging 
          works can be done automatically( a.k.a 'auto-merge'), otherwise, if there are conflicts, 
          it's the contributor's responsibility to decide how the different version shoulbe merged 
          together. Most of the time, you will be asked to make choices on which parts whould be kept,
          and which ones be abondoned.    

          2.2 
          In the upper command 'git pull -u original master', 'original' is not a keyword. 
          It's a tag used in 'git remote add orginal https://https://github.com/lian-lihui/cpp_learning.git' 

          In other words, if you previously used 'git remote add cpp-on-github https://github.com/lian-lihui/cpp_learning.git' 
          you should use 'git pull -u cpp-on-githun master' to get the laster content from the remote server. 

          Keep in mind that 'master' is the default( also is the first ) branch name when throwing lots of 
          files into git repo by 'git init'. 

          2.3 
          Read the output of git commands carefully, from which you can usually get some instructions.
